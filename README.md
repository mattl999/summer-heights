# Summer Heights :guitar:

This project is the official website for Toronto-based pop-punk band 'Summer Heights'. It is my first freelance project for a client, and I had a lot of fun making it!

The project consists of a Bootstrap/ejs frontend, and a small Node.js/MongoDB backend for the client to update their tour dates on the go!

## Technologies Used:

- EJS
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Bootstrap
- Docker
- AWS (Lightsail, ECR, Route53)

## Notes

The official domain name is in the process of being transferred from the client's registrar to Route53 (process can take up to a week), so for the moment, the raw IPv4 address is displayed in the address bar. This will be fixed and configured to use HTTPS once the transfer completes. The app is running from a docker container hosted on a Lightsail VPS instance.
